OpenXTalk
Together, we can make sure that a Free Open Source xTalk language remains available for educators and hobbyists moving forward. We are seeking contributors of all skill levels. Visit the forums at https://www.openxtalk.org to join the conversation!

OpenXTalk Lite is a fork of the OpenXTalk project.
The goal of the Lite version is a smaller, debranded version, with bug fixes.

All contributions and bug fixes especially welcome.
For the main OpenXTalk version, see https://github.com/OpenXTalk-org/OpenXtalk-IDE-DontPanicEdition
