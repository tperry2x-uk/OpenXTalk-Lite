-- This is a modification to the "Answer" and "Ask" alert dialogs.-- It really only applies to Linux OS's where you can completely theme the underlying operating system.-- This change doesn't affect people using macs, or Windows I'd assume.-- It will choose an opposite text colour for the answer and ask text fields on the dialogs, inverse to whatever the background colour of the alert window happens to be. (This ensures the text will never be the same colour as the background, and should fit in with the system).-- you shouldn't really need these on the Mac, or Windows. These mods are mainly for Linux, but replacing them anyway won't hurt.file: revanswerdialog.rev[Mac:] right-click app icon, "show package contents" > Contents/Tools/Toolset/palettes/[linux:] /opt/livecode/livecodecommunity/Toolset/palettes/[win:] C:/RunRev/LiveCode Community 9.6.1/Toolset/palettes/file: revaskdialog.rev[Mac:] right-click app icon, "show package contents" > Contents/Tools/Toolset/palettes/[linux:] /opt/livecode/livecodecommunity/Toolset/palettes/[win:] C:/RunRev/LiveCode Community 9.6.1/Toolset/palettes/
