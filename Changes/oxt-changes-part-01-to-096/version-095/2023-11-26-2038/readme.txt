-- These are cumulative changes from 0.94 to 0.95-- Made drawing the layout guides an option in the preferences-- Re-enabled online updates. From now on, I'd like all new versions to be delivered this way rather than a 400MB+ download each time. (this will come back online automatically in 5 days - on the 1st of December)-- fixed grid (size) not applying correctly-- Added a confirmation dialog when resetting the preferences-- If using multiple displays, and in the rare instance where it's positioned incorrectly, added a compatibility option to tweak the menubar stack placement under the preferences.-- Codesigning issues (MacOS only). Hopefully this is now solved. There are additional instructions inside the mac dmg to help with this if you run into problems.-- updated splash screenfile: about.dat[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/file: revSplash.livecode[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/splash/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/splash/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/Toolset/palettes/splash/file: revpreferencesgui.rev[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/Toolset/palettes/file: revmenubar.livecodescript[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/menubar/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/menubar/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/Toolset/palettes/menubar/file: revabout.rev[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/Toolset/palettes/file: revaboutcardbehavior.livecodescript[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/behaviors/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/behaviors/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/Toolset/palettes/behaviors/file: about-background.png[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/file: about-background@extra-high.png[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/file: splash.png[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/file: splash@extra-high.png[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/file: revmenubar.livecodescript[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/menubar/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/menubar/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/Toolset/palettes/menubar/file: revpreferencesgui.rev[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/Toolset/palettes/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/Toolset/palettes/file: .version[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/file: .buildnumber[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/[win:] C:/path-to-your-build/[Mac:] right-click the app > "show package contents" /Contents/Tools/file: OpenXTalk-Lite.desktop[Linux:] /opt/path-to-your-build/
