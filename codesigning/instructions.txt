You need to create a self-signed certificate.

    Open Keychain Access.
    Choose Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Create Certificate ...
    Enter a name
    Set 'Certificate Type' to 'Code Signing'

Then, your command should look like this, if your certificate name is my-new-cert:

codesign -fs my-new-cert /Applications/Utilities/Boot\ Camp\ Assistant.app

If an error "resource fork, Finder information, or similar detritus not allowed" appears, you need to remove all extended attributes first, as per Apple QA1940:

xattr -cr /Applications/Utilities/Boot\ Camp\ Assistant.app

If an error "/Applications/XYZ.app: code object is not signed at all" appears, it can be mitigated by signing not just the app, but all objects inside it:

codesign -fs my-new-cert --deep /Applications/Utilities/Boot\ Camp\ Assistant.app
